# testing automation 

1) To set up a testing environment, first follow the instructions here to install selenium dependencies: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Getting-Started

2) Afterwards, run the test code Main.java with console commands or from your ide. 

3) When the Main.java file is run, it should open a webpage with the application on it and simulate logging in and posting in the application.

4) You need to press enter to between tests to move on to the next test, as this feature was added to seperate the tests so you can further confirm the tests.
